Let me assure you that my background is unlike most of the candidates that you may have seen, giving me a  unique  perspective.  My  non-traditional  career  path  consists  of  over  12  years  of  experience  in  business  development, operations, and strategy. Following those career experiences, I put myself through college while  operating  my  own  business,  and  recently  earned  multiple  degrees,  including  a  masters  degree  from  MIT  (Massachusetts Institute of Technology).    After reviewing the roles and the required background in which your firm is looking for, I am confident that  my abilities match the needs and the culture of your firm perfectly. For example, I possess:      Experience  in  enterprise  asset  management,  strategy  consulting,  financial  analysis,  and  value  realization   across several industries, including FMCG, luxury goods, technology, automotive, and real estate        Stellar leadership and project management skills; ability to engage and lead multi-cultural teams for timely   delivery and execution. Exceptional interpersonal skills building relationship with internal/external clients       Ability  to  operate  strategically  and  tactically  in  intense  environments  with  a  high  degree  of  organization   while managing multiple and competing priorities. Career experience in Southeast Asia and USA        Experience  delivering  professional  services  focused  on  complex  business  problems  involving  commercial   and operational due diligence, post-merger integration and operational restructuring     I  completed  my  post  graduate  rotation  and  consulting  projects  in  Singapore  and  I  am  currently  holding  a  private equity related role in a global firm that I took on while I was finishing my degree from MIT. I am now  seeking  something  more  challenging  and  rewarding  in  which  to  apply  my  talents.  I  look  forward  to  the  opportunity to convey my strengths in an in-person interview.

And ranking those resumes based on the  information extracted, according to the skill sets of the candidate and based on the job  description of the company.      Today, online recruiting web sites such as Monster and Indeed.com have become one of the  main channels for people to nd jobs. These web platforms have provided their services for  more than ten years, and have saved a lot of time and money for both job seekers and  organizations who want to hire people. However, traditional information retrieval techniques  may not be appropriate for users. The reason is because the number of results returned to a job  seeker may be huge, so job seekers are required to spend a signicant amount of time reading  and reviewing their options.One popular approach to resolve this diculty for users are  recommender systems,which is a technology that has been studied for a long time.       In this thesis we have made an eort to propose a personalized job-resume matching system,  which could help job seekers to nd appropriate jobs more easily. We used a information  extraction library to extract models from resumes and job descriptions. We devised a new  statistical-based ontology similarity measure to compare the resume models and the job  models. Since the most appropriate jobs will be returned rst, the users of the system may get  a better result than current job nding web sites.       Using NLP(Natural Language Processing) and ML(Machine Learning) to rank the resumes  according to the given constraint, this intelligent system ranks the resume of any format  according to the given constraints or the following requirement provided by the client  company. We will basically take the bulk of input resume from the client company and that  client company will also provide the job description and the constraints according to which the  resume should be ranked by our system.                   6   TABLE OF CONTENTS                                                1   INTRODUCTION       1.1   Project Specification   1.2  Background & Motivation   1.3  Objective & Scope   1.4  Recommender System   1.5  A Short Introduction to Learning to Rank      2  CASE STUDY ON TALENT ACQUISITION          2.1  First Generation Hiring Systems       2.2  Second Generation Hiring Systems    2.3  First Generation Hiring Systems   3  REQUIREMENT ANALYSIS        3.1  Software Requirements       3.2  Supportive Operating Systems :       4  SYSTEM OVERVIEW & DESIGN                4.1    Project Design   4.2    System Architecture                                           Page No.   9 - 14                                                                                        15   16 - 17   18 - 19   7   5   IMPLEMENTATION                         20 - 25   5.1   Working          5.2   Information Extraction   5.3   RANKING USING K-NEAREST NEIGHBOR                   5.4   Content Based Filtering Approach   6  TESTING AND EVALUATION         6.1   KNN Performance               6.2   Content Based Filtering Performance                       26 - 27   7   CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK                                                   28 - 29    7.1   Conclusion             7.2   Future Work                      REFERENCES                                                                                             30-31                                                 8      LIST OF FIGURES AND TABLES      1.

With the increased mobility  of job seekers in recent years, more and more jobs are seeing rapidly growing pools of potential  candidates, requiring respective recruiters to wade through hundreds if not thousands of CVs to  nd the perfect match.   When there is a large number of candidates, the automation can also include a more  challenging task: scoring and ranking candidates CVs according to their match to a job posting  (represented concretely as a query). This task is usually implicitly performed by a search  engines retrieval model, which computes ranking scores based on the text overlap of the CVs  with the query keywords. While text similarity might reect good matches for some jobs, it is  easy to nd examples where this naive approach fails (e.g. a warehouse manager should not  appear on top of a list for assistant warehouse manager). Improvement could be obtained  through data-driven approaches, however, in the domain of recruitment it is very costly to  compile and annotate enough data so that supervised learning would be possible    This thesis takes on a data-driven approach but avoids the hand labelling of training data by  using a different kind of information: We use a dataset with recruiters hiring decisions to learn  a ranking model, which can improve on the initial search ranking. For this purpose we rst  introduce eld relevance models for CVs, which are generally unsupervised models that can  take advantage of implicit domain knowledge in a large collection of CVs. We demonstrate in an  experiment that such a model has the potential to improve the recall of retrieval when applied  in a simple query expansion set-up.    To improve the ranking of CVs we take on a feature-oriented, learning-to-rank approach (LTR),  i.e. we propose a number of features for our problem domain, forming the basis for a machine  learning algorithm whose resulting model is a ranking model. In particular, we also propose  features which can be computed based on the eld relevance models.    The main contributions of this thesis can be summarised as follows:    We propose an unsupervised model that can take advantage of implicit knowledge to  summarize every resume and extract information from it.    We adopt a feature-oriented view of retrieval and describe a number of features that can be  used in a learning-to-rank framework for the ranking of CVs.     We used K Nearest Neighbours and Content based filtering algorithm for the ranking of CVs  according to job description   10   1.2 Background & Motivation   Hiring the right person for the right job is a common challenge faced by all companies.  Especially for positions with a large number of applicants the search for the right candidate(s)  can feel like looking for a needle in the haystack. In these situations traditional methods of  recruitment can be too expensive and time-consuming to be a viable option. Hence, not  surprisingly, recruitment technology that can facilitate this process are in high demand. E.g.  using a (searchable) database of candidates and a search engine a recruiter can preselect a  small number of suitable candidates from a much larger pool so as to assess them in further  recruitment procedure. It should be noted that the goal of such software is not to replace the  human in human resources but to make the decision process smoother for the recruiter. For  this purpose an increasing number of software packages provide means for executing recurring  tasks automatically. Both CVs and job postings can be automatically parsed and relevant  information is extracted and stored in databases. Easy-to-use interfaces are provided for  maintaining the quality of extracted information (e.g. for manual corrections) and for keeping  track of typical HR processes involving vacancies, candidates and interviews(so-called applicant  tracking systems or ATS). With the growing importance of social media, more and more  companies nowadays also offer social recruiting capabilities, which can tap into an even  larger, more global pool of qualied candidates through social media platforms such as LinkedIn  and Xing. Thus, in order to take full advantage of the bigger candidate pools, it is crucial to  apply smart search and ranking strategies such that good candidates are indeed placed on top  and do not disappear in the crowd.   The goal of this thesis is to extend the search and ranking component of an existing commercial  recruitment software package. In particular, we target the ranking component of a CV search  engine, which is responsible for scoring and ranking candidates CVs for queries (either issued  by users or automatically translated from job postings). This existing software offers some basic  functionalities, which form the foundation of many common recruitment processes:    The automatic CV parsing extracts relevant information such as name, address, skills and  previous work experience from original CVs (e.g. given as PDF or DOC documents) and  transforms them into a searchable semi-structured format.    The search engine indexes parsed CVs and enables searching with semi-structured queries as  well as through search facets and tag clouds. CVs are assigned a relevance score w.r.t. the  query by the search engine and are ranked accordingly.    Automatic vacancy parsing extracts relevant information from vacancies such as the title of  the advertised position, skill requirements and other job-opening-related keywords.    The query generation component automatically generates semi structured search queries for  nding matching candidates in the document collection.    11   The CV and vacancy parsing models are machine-learned models, which are trained to detect  relevant phrases and sections in CVs and vacancies and can infer what kind of information the  given phrase represents. Knowing the meaning of relevant parts of a CV allows more  sophisticated search and ltering options, e.g. by searching only in the skills section or ltering  candidates by their years of experience.    The workow that we are mainly interested in involves the query generation component, which  uses the information obtained from the vacancy parsing model and generates a query  according to a predened template. This kind of query is generally longer than user dened  queries and contains a lot more information. An example query is given in Listing 1, which  contains both terms that should match in specic elds and terms which can match anywhere  in the CV (so-called fulltext terms).    Thus, these queries provide a good basis for nding candidates that match the original job  posting well with very little human effort. Based on the search terms in the generated query,  the search engine in our current system computes a score for each candidates CV, according to  which a nal ranking is created. The focus of our work is to extend this current ranking system  by learning a model that can re-rank an already ranked list of candidates according to some  notion of suitability for a given query. Concretely, the initial ranking is performed by the search  engines TFIDF based retrieval model. Our re-ranking model should manipulate the ranking of  this preselected list to ensure that the best candidates are placed on top. Furthermore, we  want to gain some understanding of the aspects that play a role in the learning and the ranking  procedure and how they relate to possible notions of  suitability /relevance.    This task is challenging because we face a logical (i.e. given the already existing set-up) but  highly competitive baseline provided by the search ranking. Previous user feedback suggests  that the retrieval model used by the search engine already captures some notion of relevance  that has a correspondence to the suitability of candidates. The approach that this work follows  to tackle this challenge is one of machine learning, i.e. we want to learn a model from data  without having to craft a ranking function or ranking rules explicitly. This approach requires a  suitable dataset from which a ranking model can be learned. The details of the datasets that are  used in our project are given in the next section.    The practical motivation for our learning approach is the availability of a relatively large dataset  which contains real-world job ads, original CVs of the applicants for these jobs as well as  information about which candidates were hired in the end of the recruitment process. We will  refer to this dataset as the hiring decisions. Another, much smaller dataset contains human  relevance judgements for a number of job ads and CVs of people who did not necessarily apply  for the given job(in this thesis referred to as the relevance assessments).          12   1.3 Objective and scope   The major objective of our system is to take the current resume ranking system to other level  and makes it more flexible for both the entity.    1) Candidates, who has been hired.   2) Client company, who is hiring the candidates.   Candidates, who has been hired : Candidates who are searching for jobs after been graduated.  Out of those, major number of candidates are so much desperate that they are ready to work  on any post irrelevant to their skill set and ability.    The main reason behind this unemployment is like a cancer to our society, if a guyis not got  place after been passed out for 1yr, society include relatives starting blaming that guy. Inspite  of this reason the candidate are ready to work in any condition, on any post. So they dont have  to face those situation.    Where our system help such candidates to get hired by such a company or an organisation who  really worth their ability and their skill sets. Where our algorithm will work in such a way that  with the help of the previous result and previous ranking constraints, it will try to optimize the  current result, which we called it Machine Learning.    This will make sure that the relevant candidate is been hired for that particular vacancy. You  can say best possible candidate.   Client company, who is hiring the candidates : Like I am the owner of a particular organisation,  obviously my aim would be to create such a team which is the best team in the world. It is like,  if there is a vacancy of a java developer in my organisation. So, I wont prefer to hire a python  developer and then make him learn Java. That will be pretty useless and time consuming for  both that candidate and for the organisation too.    Where our system help the organisation to make out the best possible candidates list according  to their given constraints and requirement for that particular vacancy.    This kind of approach, will help our hiring sector to improve like anything and make it more  efficient as the relevant person is getting a relevant job. So there would be no regrets for both  the entities, client company and that hired candidate. Hence satisfaction will be achieved.    As we know Indian I.T sector is second largest candidate recruiting sector of our country. It  contribute about 7.5% to our Gross Domestic Product(G.D.P) Our Proposed system is initially  concerned with the I.T sector of our country. It is mainly going to deal the Indian I.T industry  but if you talk about the pro version of our system it can be extended to various other  commercial sector where, intake and elimination are in bulk like for Govermental Jobs.      13   1.4 Recommender System   Job searching, which has been the focus of some commercial job nding web sites and research  papers is not a new topic in information retrieval. Usually scholars called them Job  Recommender Systems (JRS), because most of them used technologies from recommender  systems. Wei et al classied Recommender Systems into four categories[48] : Collaborative  Filtering, Content-based ltering, Knowledge based and Hybrid approaches. Some of these  techniques had been applied into JRS; Zheng et al. [44] and AlOtaibi et al. [3] summarized the  categories of existing online recruiting platforms and listed the advantages and disadvantages  of technicalapproaches in dierent JRSs. The categories include:   1.  Content-based Recommendation (CBR) -    The principle of a content-based recommendation is to suggest items that have similar  content information to the corresponding users, like Prospect [43].   2.  Collaborative Filtering Recommendation (CFR)     Collaborative ltering recommendation nds similar users who have the same taste with  the target user and recommends items based on what the similar users, like CASPER [35].   3.   Knowledge-based Recommendation (KBR)    In the knowledge-based recommendation, rules and patterns obtained from the  functional knowledge of how aspecic item meets the requirement of a particular user,  are used for recommending items, like Proactive [24].   4.  Hybrid recommender systems combine two or more recommendation techniques to gain   better performance, and overcome the drawbacks of any individual one. Usually,  collaborative ltering is combined with some other technique in an attempt to avoid the  ramp-up problem.    Rafter et al. began to use Automated Collaborative Filtering (ACF) in their Job Recommender  System, CASPER [35]. All these factors are viewed as measure of relevance among users. The  system recommend jobs in two steps: First, the system nds a set of users related to the target  user; second, the jobs that related users liked will be recommend to the target user. The  system use cluster-based collaborative ltering strategy.    CASPER also allows users to search jobs by a query which is a combination of some elds: like  location, salary, skill and so on. The system uses such query to nd jobs, and the returned jobs  are ranked with the collaborative ltering algorithm.In their paper, the authors do not give a  detailed description on how to detect the related elds they need and how to the transfer  semi-structured job description to the structured data.   The shortages of collaborative ltering: First, since the number of search results is huge, and  the results are sorted randomly, the probability of two similar usersreviewing the same jobs is  low, which causes the sparsity problem of collaborativeltering. Second,because  recommended jobs are from others users search results, since the quality of current searching  result are low, the quality of recommendation cannot be high.   14   1.5  A Short Introduction to Learning to Rank   Learning to rank refers to machine learning techniques for training the model in a ranking task.  Learning to rank is useful for many applications in Information Retrieval, Natural Language  Processing, and Data Mining. Intensive stud-ies have been conducted on the problem and  significant progress has been made. This short paper gives an introduction to learning to rank,  and it specifically explains the fundamental problems, existing approaches, and future work of  learning to rank   Fig 1: Overview of Ranking System      1.6.1 Weaknesses  1. Prior systems needed lot of human efforts and time.  2. Cost of hiring is high.   3. Potential candidate may loose the opportunity because of ambigious keyword matching.             4. Resumes needed to be in specific format.    1.6.2 How to overcome  1. Use of NLP to read resumes allow candidates the freedom to choose any format that's  avalible to them.   2. Machine learning is used to rank candidates in accordiance to requirements Which reduces  the efforts of sorting thousands of resumes.   3. Use of NLP can be used to get mean out of ambigious data.  4. Five benifits of A.I. -Goes Beyond Key Words, Fast and Accurate, Perfect For the New World  of Social Recruiting ,Customizes to your Needs, Gets Smarter   15   Chapter 2         Case Study on talent acquisition      2.1 First Generation Hiring Systems    In this System the Hiring team would publish their vacancies and invite applicants. Methods of  publishing were newspaper, television and mouth. The interested candidates would then apply  by sending there resumes. These resumes were then received and sorted by the hiring team  and shortlisted candidates were called for further rounds of interviews. The whole process  would take lot of time and human efforts to find right candidate suitable for their job roles.   2.2 Second Generation Hiring Systems   As the industries have grown, there hiring needs has rapidly grown. To serve this hiring needs  certain consultancy units have came into existence. They offered a solution in which the  candidate has to upload their information in a particular format and submit it to the agency.  Then these agencies would search the candidates based on certain keywords. These agencies  were middle level organizations between the candidate and company. These systems were not  flexible as the candidate has to upload there resume in a particular formats, and these formats  changed from system to system.    2.3 Third Generation Hiring Systems    This is our proposed system, which allow the candidates to upload their resumes in flexible  format. These resumes are then analyzed by our system, indexed and stored in a specific  format. This makes our search process easy. The analyzing system works on the algorithm that  uses Natural Language Processing, sub domain of Artificial Intelligence. It reads the resumes  and understands the natural language/format created by the candidate and transforms it into a  specific format. This acquired knowledge is stored in the knowledge base. The system acquires  more information about candidate from his social profiles like Linkedin and Github and updates  the knowledge base. Ranking   Attributes are:    1) Current Compensation    2) Expected Compensation   3) Education       4) Specialization   5) Location                 6) Earliest Start Date     7) Work Gap                                             8) Total Experience    9) Relevant Experience               10) Communication               11) Current Employer               12) Stability              13) Education Gap    16   Chapter 3            Requirement Analysis  The tutorial is intended to be accessible for enthusiasts, engineers, and data scientists at all skill  levels. The only skills that you will need are a basic understanding of Python and enough  knowledge of the command line to setup a project.       3.1 Software Requiremtents    The software reuirements in this project include:     Python     NLTK    Machine Learning    Python:   Python is used for creating backbone structure. Python is intended to be a highly readable  language. It is designed to have an uncluttered visual layout, it uses whitespace indentation,  rather than curly braces or keywords. Python has a large standard library, commonly cited as  one of Python's greatest strengths.     WebCrawlers: BeautifulSoap (Python Package)   BeautifulSoap is an application framework for crawling web sites and extracting structured data  which can be used for a wide range of useful applications, like data mining, information  processing or historical archival. Even though BeautifulSoap was originally designed for web  scraping, it can also be used to extract data using APIs (such as Amazon Associates Web  Services) or as a general purpose web crawler. BeautifulSoap is controlled through the  BeautifulSoap command-line tool, to be referred here as the BeautifulSoap tool to  differentiate it from the sub-commands, which we just call commands or BeautifulSoap  commands. The BeautifulSoap tool provides several commands, for multiple purposes, and  each one accepts a different set of arguments and options.    Natural Language Processing Tool : Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK) (Python Package)   NLTK was originally created in 2001 as part of a computational linguistics course in the  Department of Computer and Information Science at the University of Pennsylvania. Since then  it has been developed and expanded with the help of dozens of contributors. It has now been  adopted in courses in dozens of universities, and serves as the basis of many research projects.  NLTK was designed with four primary goals in mind:   Simplicity : To provide an intuitive framework along with substantial building blocks, giving  users a practical knowledge of NLP without getting bogged down in the tedious house-keeping  usually associated with processing annotated language data .    17   Consistency : To provide a uniform framework with consistent interfaces and data structures,  and easily guessable method names .   Extensibility : To provide a structure into which new software modules can be easily  accommodated, including alternative implementations and competing approaches to the same  task.   Modularity : To provide components that can be used independently without needing to  understand the rest of the toolkit.A significant fraction of any NLP syllabus deals with  algorithms and data structures. On their own these can be rather dry, but NLTK brings them to  life with the help of interactive graphical user interfaces that make it possible to view  algorithms step-by-step. Most NLTK components include a demonstration that performs an  interesting task without requiring any special input from the user. An effective way to deliver  the materials is through interactive presentation of the examples in this book, entering them in  a Python session, observing what they do, and modifying them to explore some empirical or  theoretical issue.    Machine Learning tool : Scikit-learn (Python Package)   It is a Python module integrating classic machine learning algorithms in the tightly-knit scientific  Python world (numpy, scipy, matplotlib). It aims to provide simple and efficient solutions to  learning problems, accessible to everybody and reusable in various contexts: machine-learning  as a versatile tool for science and engineering.   In general, a learning problem considers a set of n samples of data and try to predict properties  of unknown data. If each sample is more than a single number, and for instance a  multidimensional entry (aka multivariate data), is it said to have several attributes, or features.  We can separate learning problems in a few large categories:    Supervised learning , in which the data comes with additional attributes that we want to  predict .This problem can be either: classification: samples belong to two or more classes and  we want to learn from already labeled data how to predict the class of unlabeled data. An  example of classification problem would be the digit recognition example, in which the aim is to  assign each input vector to one of a finite number of discrete categories.  regression: if the  desired output consists of one or more continuous variables, then the task is called regression.  An example of a regression problem would be the prediction of the length of a salmon as a  function of its age and weight.   Unsupervised learning , in which the training data consists of a set of input vectors x without  any corresponding target values. The goal in such problems may be to discover groups of  similar examples within the data, where it is called clustering, or to determine the distribution  of data within the input space, known as density estimation, or to project the data from a high- dimensional space down to two or thee dimensions for the purpose of visualization.     3.2 Supportive Operating Systems :  The supported Operating Systems for client include:    Windows 7 onwards       Linux any flavour.            18   Chapter 4         System Overview and Design      4.1 Project Design   Design is the first step in the development phase for any techniques and principles for the  purpose of defining a device, a process or system in sufficient detail to permit its physical  realization. Once the software requirements have been analyzed and specified the software  design involves three technical activities design, coding, implementation and testing that are  required to build and verify the software. The design activities are of main importance in this  phase, because in this activity, decisions ultimately affecting the success of the software  implementation and its ease of maintenance are made..    The system uses information extraction technique to parse job descriptions and resumes, and it  gets information such as skills, job titles and education background. The information is used to  create the models of job openings and job seekers. A domain specic ontology is used to  construct the knowledge base, which includes the taxonomies that support resume-job  matching.   The models of resume includes job seekers specialties, working experience and education  background, and all the elds are extracted from their resumes. The job models are extracted  from job descriptions, and they have the same information elds as the resume models. When  a job seeker searches the jobs by their resume, the system calculates the similarity between the  resume model and job models, then gives every job model a similarity value.    Our system follows the three tier architecture . First tier consist of GUI, Processing block and  the Database.    GUI: The GUI(Graphical User Interface) in our project deals with the interface for the user  where the user will  submit his resumes and job description in any format(pdf, doc,  docx,ect.).The GUI provides a platform for the user to communicate with the database. It acts  as a connector as well as communicator which connects the database and helps in transfer of  data between the GUI and the database.    Processing block: Processing block is the block where the actual processing of our project is  done. This block connects the gui to the database i.e. it acts as a connector as well as  communicator which connects the database and helps in transfer of data between the gui and  the database. Its main function is to take input from resumes, convert them to text  and parse it  to store the information in database. After storing this information this system will give output  using web application.   Database: Database tier is the tier used for the storage of data. This tier contains all the data  that is need for the processing of the whole project. The data in this tier is related to the  student information gathered form his/her resumes.   19   4.2 System Architecture    Figure shows the architecture of the whole system, which includes such modules:   1. The Web Crawler can access and download resumes from indeed.com everyday.   2. The Job Parser can parse job description given by recruiter, extract the information and  create the job model.   3. The Resume Parser is much like the Job Parser; it parses the resumes,convert all resume files  to text file , summarize every resume content and creates the resume models.   4. All the  job models and resume model are stored in the database.   5. After that machine learning techniquues are applied to rank the resumes acoording to job  description.    Information Extraction is the task of automatically extracting structured information such as  entities, relationships between entities, and attributes describing entities from unstructured  sources [42]. The IE framework in our system uses six stages in order to extract the information  from job descriptions: HTML parsing,segmenting, preprocessing, tokenizing, labeling and  pattern matching, which is show in Figure .   Fig 2: System Architecture      20   Chapter 5           Implementation        5.1 Working    1) The HTML Parsing will parse the web pages that contain job descriptions, which are obtained  from web crawler. The parser uses HTML tag template to extract attributes of the jobs, like job  title, location, company name, content and so on. A job will be saved as a record with these  attributes in the database. In the record, the content eld contains the text part of the job  description, which will be processed inlater stages.   2) In the segmenting stage, the content eld of the job description is be separated into  paragraphs according HTML tags. Then paragraphs are separated into sentences by either  HTML tags or punctuation, and after this step, all HTML tags will be removed.   3) Web pages of job description are created in dierent character sets, (e.g. UTF8 and ISO 8859- 1), and almost always contain some unreadable characters. In theprepossessing stage,  characters in the sentences are converted to ASCII characters,unreadable characters will be  deleted, and some punctuation will be replaced by spaces (e.g. / and -).   4) Now resume are downloaded by webcrawler or one can directly upload resume through GUI  interface.   5) Every resume file is then converted to a text file and data of each resume is summarized for  fast processing. Summarization is performed to remove stopwords and special characters. This  is done using NLTK corpus dictionary of stopwords.   6) In the tokenizing stage, the sentences of job description will be tokenized into arrays of  tokens by NLTK [5] and TFIDF Vectorizer.This formed array is named as Item-Feature matrix.   7) Now each resume is taken and tokenized using TFIDF Vectorizer. A new 2-D array is formed  in which each row contains tokenized items of single resume. Column attributes in this array is  features of item feature matrix. This array is named as User-Feature matrix   8) In the pattern matching  and ranking stage, the KNN algorithm and Content Based Filtering  algorithm is used to match the user features with the features of job description.    9) After this resume are ranked in decending order seperately by each algorithm and the output  is shown on GUI interface.   21   Figure 3: Job Description Process Pipeline      We will describe some implementation details here. The whole system is implemented in  Python and uses some third party libraries and frameworks. We used Flask, a lightweight web  framework, to build the web application. We used pdf to text le parser, Python Lex-Yacc (PLY)  as the token regular expression compiler, and Beautiful Soup as the HTML parser. All the jobs  and resumes retrieved by the Web Crawler are stored database. For the natural language  processing procedure,we used Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK), a natural language processing  library,to extract and tokenize the sentences.                        22   5.2 Information Extraction    In this chapter we will explain how the Information Extraction (IE) module of our system  extracts information from these unstructured data source. An example of job description is  shown in Table. The IE framework will be introduced by example of processing the job  descriptions and resumes. The Gensim, which is used as summarization tools, will be  introduced as well.   Gensim : is a robust open-source vector space modeling and topic modeling toolkit  implemented in Python. It uses NumPy, SciPy and optionally Cython for performance. Gensim is  specifically designed to handle large text collections, using data streaming and efficient  incremental algorithms, which differentiates it from most other scientific software packages  that only target batch and in-memory processing. Gensim includes implementations of tf-idf,  random projections, word2vec and document2vec algorithms, hierarchical Dirichlet processes  (HDP), latent semantic analysis (LSA, LSI, SVD) and latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA), including  distributed parallel versions   TF-IDF Vectorizer: In information retrieval, tfidf or TFIDF, short for term frequencyinverse  document frequency, is a numerical statistic that is intended to reflect how important a word is  to a document in a collection or corpus. It is often used as a weighting factor in searches of  information retrieval, text mining, and user modeling. The tf-idf value increases proportionally  to the number of times a word appears in the document and is offset by the frequency of the  word in the corpus, which helps to adjust for the fact that some words appear more frequently  in general. Nowadays, tf-idf is one of the most popular term-weighting schemes; 83% of text- based recommender systems in the domain of digital libraries use tf-idf.   Variations of the tfidf weighting scheme are often used by search engines as a central tool in  scoring and ranking a document's relevance given a user query. tfidf can be successfully used  for stop-words filtering in various subject fields, including text summarization and classification.   One of the simplest ranking functions is computed by summing the tfidf for each query term;  many more sophisticated ranking functions are variants of this simple model.   5.2.1 Basic Features   Our basic set of features are based on the elds of the indexed documents and the queries:  Most of these features can be described as match features, i.e. they denote whether the  value(s) of a eld given in the query matched the value(s) of the same eld in the document.  This information is usually returned by the search engine in the form of a score for each  indexed eld, which can be directly used as a feature.          23   5.2.2 Match Features   Match features are crucial query-document features, i.e. they depend both on the query and  the document, hence, giving an indication about how well a document matches a specic  query. Table shows the elds for which we have dened match features. For the elds that can  have multiple values, e.g. compskills, we concretely dened several match features: 1) the  match score averaged over all values given in the query, 2) the maximum match score (only  relevant for the oat score variant) and 3) the sum of all match scores.    In addition to query terms associated with certain elds most of our queries also contain  fulltext search terms, i.e. terms that can match in any eld. Hence, we also dened match  features for these terms.

For  each training job description, we define a feature vector and represent it in the query feature  space (a Euclidean space). Given a new resume, we try to find the k closest training queries to it  in terms of Euclidean distance. We then train a local ranking model online using the  neighboring training queries (denoted as Nk(q)) and rank the documents of the test query using  the trained local model. For local model training, we can in principle employ any existing  learning to rank algorithm.    We call the corresponding algorithm KNN. Figure illustrates the workings of the algorithm  where the square denotes test query q, triangles denote training queries, and the large circle  denotes the neighborhood of query q. The details of the algorithm are presented in Figure.  Needless to say, the query features used in the method are critical to its accuracy. In this paper,  we simply use the following heuristic method to derive query features and leave further  investigation of the issue to future work. For each query q, we use a reference model to find its  top T ranked documents, and take the mean of the feature values of the T documents as a  feature of the query. For example, if one feature of the document is tf-idf, then the  corresponding query feature becomes average tf-idf of top T ranked documents of the query. If  there are many relevant documents, then it is very likely that the value of average tf-idf would  be high.    Algorithm: KNN    Input:   (1) A test job description and the associated documents to be ranked.   (2) Training data {S qi , i = 1, ..., m}.   (3) Reference model hr .   (4) Number of nearest neighbors k.     Output: Ranked list for query q.   pre-processing:   For each training query qi , use reference model hr to find its top T ranked documents, and compute its  query features from these documents.  Online training and testing:   (a) Use reference model hr to find the top T ranked documents for query q, and compute qs query  dependent features from these documents.   (b) Within the training data find k nearest neighbors of q, denoted as Nk(q), with distance computed in  the query feature space.  (c) Apply hq to the documents associated with query q, and obtain the ranked list.              25   5.4 Content-based filtering approach     Content-based filtering (CBF) is treated as information retrieval problem or machine learning  problem. In information retrieval problem, the document representations have to be matched  to user representations on textual similarity while, in machine learning problem, the textual  content of the representations are combined as feature vectors, which are used for training a  prediction algorithm There are two main tasks related to CBF recommender systems, the User  profiling and the Item representation. User profiling is one of most challenging tasks in CBF  recommender systems that deal with acquiring, extracting A and representing the features of  users. However, the user interface can easily be created to assist users building their profiles.  classified the profile information into two types:   (1) the users preferences such as item description that interest the user. There are many  possible representations of this description, but the common representation is using a function  to predict the possibility of user is interested in that item.   (2) The users interactions history with the recommendation system that includes saving the  items that a user has viewed with information about users interaction.   Now that we have learned all these concepts, lets actually try to build a simple content based  recommender based on job description.  Hence, having a recommender system would help.    For binary representation, we can perform normalization by dividing the term occurrence(1/0) by the  sqrt of number of attributes in the resume. Hence, for resume 1: normalized attribute = 1/sqrt(3) =  0.577.   A question that you must ask here is: what happened to TF? and why did we directly do  normalization before calculating the TF scores? If you calculate TF without normalization, the TF  scores will be 1+log 10 1 = 1 for attributes that occur and simply 0 for attributes that dont. And,  thus the TF scores will also becomes 1/0.    The dot product of job description vectors and IDF vectors of resumes gives us the weighted scores of  each resume. These weighted scores are again used for a dot product with the user profile vector (user 1  here)..   This concept can be applied to n resume  and we can find out which resume is best .  Therefore, along with new resume in a week, a separate recommendation can be made to a  particular job description.   In this article, we have seen two approaches to content based recommenders. They both use  the TF-IDF weighting and vector space model implementations, albeit in different ways. So  while the count data helped us understand the methodology of calculating the weighted scores  of resume, the binary representation helped us understand how to calculate the scores for data  represented as 1/0 and we also saw how ranking are generated and predictions are made  based on that.   26   Chapter 6           Testing and Evaluation      6.1 KNN Performance   We compared the proposed KNN methods with the baselines of the single model approach  (denoted as Single) and the query classification based approach (denoted as QC). For the  second baseline, we implemented the query type classifier proposed in [26] to classify queries  into three categories (topic distillation, name page finding, and home page finding). Then we  trained one ranking model for each category. For a test query, we first applied the classifier to  determine its type, and then used the corresponding ranking model to rank its associated  documents.We make the following observations from these results:    (1) The better results of KNN over Single indicate that query dependent ranking does help, and  an approach like KNN can indeed effectively accomplish the task.    (2) The superior results of KNN to QC indicate that an approach based on soft classification of  queries like KNN is more successful than an approach based on hard classification of queries  like QC.    (3) QC cannot work better than Single, mainly due to the relatively low accuracy of query  classification. In fact, the accuracies of classification in terms of F1 measure are only about 60%  in the two datasets.    Errors in the query classification can greatly damage the results of document ranking. This also  shows that it is not easy to develop a query dependent ranking method that can beat  conventional ranking methods. In contrast, the KNN methods can successfully leverage the  ranking patterns of similar queries and achieve better ranking performances.   Effects of Different k Values    We tested the performances of the KNN methods with different values of parameter k, the  number of nearest neighbors selected. Notice that when k = m, KNN becomes equivalent to  Single, where m denotes the number of training queries. Figure 8 shows the performances of  the proposed methods on Dataset 1 with different k values in terms of NDCG@5 and  NDCG@10. From this figure, we can see that as k increases, the performances first increase and  then decrease. More specifically,    (1) When only a small number of neighbors are used, the performances of KNN are not so good  due to the insufficiency of training data.   (2) When the numbers of neighbors increase, the performances gradually improve, because of  the use of more information.   (3) However, when too many neighbors are used (approaching 1500, which is equivalent to  Single), the performances begin to deteriorate. This seems to indicate that query dependent  ranking can really help.   27   6.2 Content Based Filtering Performance  The very poor performance of the word-only based approach tf-idfm has been omitted .The  counter-performance of the baseline metrics LSAm on the top of the LSA representation is  blamed on the poor overlap of the job announcement and CV vocabularies. The limitations of  the LSA representation can be alleviated using the convolutional metrics (legend LSAu), with an  improvement of circa 25%. Two main lessons are learned.    In the evaluation phase, we created a data set of 100 job descriptions that includes several  kinds of jobs such as web developers, server back-end developers, mobile developers and so  on. We used 5 candidate resumes and retrieved the top 20 jobs. The relevance value of the  job descriptions to each resume were set manually by ten human judge. We created a query q  from the job descriptions, treated the text of the resumes as documents d, and applied  standard ad-hoc retrieval techniques to rank theresumes. We intended to return jobs that  better matched the candidates resumes at the top.   To evaluate the performance of the information extraction module, we extract sentence types  through the use of sentence lters. To explain the process of our experiment, we use the  sentences whose content pertains to the applicants college degree information.   In the experiment, we selected 100 sentences from existing job descriptions, and the content of  these sentences were requirements of candidate degree and major. We labeled the values for  degree and major manually. We use some content patterns that we can identify from these  sentences to match and extract the degree information. When we used 6 patterns, the  accuracy of degree became 94%. We also compared our pattern matching method to the  conditional random elds (CRFs) model [22], which is a state of art machine learning model for  sequence labeling. We used 200 labelled sentences to train the CRF model, and the features of  the CRF model are words in the sentences and part of speech tags of the words. The accuracies  of information extraction of the three elds with our two methods, pattern matching, and the  application of the CRF model.    The fact that 80% of the relevant resumes are found in the top-200 recommended resumes is  very satisfactory from the application viewpoint, as each recruiter (resp. job seeker) commonly  examines several hundred CVs (resp. job announcements). This good result confirms the quality  and representativity of the data. As already said however, the collaborative filtering setting  does not correspond to the general setting of the job matching application, that mostly  considers new job announcements and CVs.             28   Chapter 7        Conclusion and Future Work      7.1 Conclusion   This work has made an extensive effort to provide a system through which the resumes can be  ranked with maximum efficiency. By implementing this system, the task of obtaining the most  relevant resumes can be achieved which will save the recruiter time to manually select  appropriate resumes, which even after processing may not be a complete fit for the profile.  Since, there are multiple levels of screening involved in order to find the most relevant  resumes; the accuracy of the system also improves. Thus, using this ranking technique, we can  obtain the best results for obtaining the ideal resumes. This approach will automate as well as  speedup the process of the HR recruiters.    In the system, job descriptions and resumes are parsed into job models and resume models by  the information extraction module. When searching the jobs by a resume, similarity values  between the resume model and job description models are calculated in the ontology matching  module. The result is sorted by the ontology similarity scores, which are the sum of similarities  of dierent elds multiplied by their weights.   We made such contributions in our works:   1. We developed a resume - job matching system.   2. We used a TFIDF based matching tool to extract information from unstructured data source,  which is a lightweight and exible library, and can be extended in very easy ways.   3. We developed a semi-automatic approach, which can collect technical terms from hr data  sources, and by which we created a domain specic ontology for recruitment.   4. We developed statistical-based ontology similarity measure, which can measure the  similarities between technical terms .   In the experiment phase, we evaluated the accuracy of information extraction.   We calculated the ontology similarity with the NDCG. Finally, we also tested the performance of  resume job matching algorithm NDCG, which showed that our algorithm can achieve a better  searching result than other information retrieval models like TF-IDF . We also compared our  system with the commercial ranking system, and the results showed that our system can return  better results.            29   7.2 Future Work   Finding a job is a complex process, aected by both explicit and implicit factors. Our work  establishes the validity of using information extraction techniques to create a more  personalized job matching system, with ample potential for improvement in the future.   First we can introduce a more complex job and resume model to improve performance of the  system. In the resume model, we can consider hiring history and project experience of the job  seekers. To improve the job description model, job responsibilities and company characteristics  (size, dress code, etc.) should be considered as well.   Second, to improve searching speed of our system, we can reduce the number of comparison  by ltering out jobs that are clearly not related to resumes. The systemcan classify the jobs into  some dierent subsets, when searching jobs, the system only need to calculate the similarity  between the resume and according subset of jobs. Resume Screening System is a content based  recommendation system that is mostly focused on comparing the similarities between the  resume and a relevant job description.   In future work, we could introduce a hybrid recommendation system that would take  advantage of other recommendation algorithms such as Collaborative Filtering. Future work on  this system would place greater consideration on job seekers personal preference like job  location, career development plan, and company background   The systems designed so far extracts all the information about the candidate only through  his/her resume and after extraction it stores the information in a centralized database, finally  ranking them and giving the top 50 results to the HR recruiter according to their specifications.  Future advancements in this system can be as follows:    1. The profiles of the candidates can be tracked on social media sites as this will help in  analyzing the personality of the candidate and whether he/she is a perfect fit for the post can  be judged.   2. Analysis can be done over the past records of the candidate which will help us determine his  expected tenure of work in the organization.                  30    References     [1] Deepak Agarwal, Bee-Chung Chen, Pradheep Elango, and Raghu Ramakrishnan.
